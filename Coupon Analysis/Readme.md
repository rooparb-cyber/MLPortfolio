**Takeaway Coupon Acceptance Analysis**
This project analyzes a dataset to identify the target demographic most likely to accept a coupon for a takeaway meal. The goal is to provide actionable insights for a future marketing campaign.

**ðŸ“Š Key Findings**
The analysis focused on three main demographic features: gender, age, and marital status.

_Analysis by Gender_
When comparing coupon acceptance rates between genders, a noticeable difference emerged.

Males showed a 4.5% higher acceptance rate than females for the takeaway coupon in this dataset.

It's important to note that while there is an observable difference, a formal statistical test (such as a chi-squared test) would be required to confirm if this result is statistically significant and not due to random chance.

_Analysis by Age and Gender_
Drilling down into specific age groups revealed distinct patterns within each gender.

46-year-old females had a notably high acceptance rate compared to other females.

36-year-old males stood out with a particularly high acceptance rate among all male age groups.

These specific age brackets appear to be sweet spots for this type of promotion.

_Analysis by Marital Status_
Marital status also appears to be a significant factor in coupon acceptance, with clear trends among different groups.

Divorced men showed the highest acceptance rates among all male groups and a very high rate overall.

Widowed females also demonstrated a high acceptance rate, though slightly lower than that of divorced males.

A key limitation here is the small sample size for widowed individuals (19 females and 7 males). The data for this group may not be as representative as for larger demographic segments.

**ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion & Target Profile**
Based on this preliminary analysis, the ideal target customer for a takeaway coupon campaign appears to be:

A divorced male.

More specifically, males around the age of 36 or females around the age of 46.

Focusing marketing efforts on these specific segments could potentially yield a higher coupon redemption rate. Future work should include formal statistical testing to validate these initial findings.
